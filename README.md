# 0.11-vue-practice
In this project, I learned about the basic concepts of Vue 3 and wanted to compare them with React projects. The application uses - CRUD, sorting, search, pagination, dynamic pagination, mixins, directives, as well as vuex and composition api for working with state.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
